# The Developer

With over a decade of experience in software development, I specialize in creating web applications that prioritize user experience, accessibility, and performance. I work primarily with TypeScript, Vue, and modern web technologies.

My approach to development is informed by my philosophical backgroundâ€”I believe that code should be not just functional, but elegant, maintainable, and ethical in its impact on users and society.
