# The Photographer

Photography, for me, is a practice of mindful observation. Through the lens, I seek to capture not just what things look like, but how they feelâ€”the quality of light, the texture of emotion, the poetry hidden in everyday moments.

My work ranges from intimate portraits to landscape photography, always with an eye toward revealing the extraordinary within the ordinary.
