# Morning Light

There's something magical about the quality of light in the early morning hours. This photograph was taken during a quiet walk through the local park, when the sun was just beginning to filter through the autumn leaves.

The interplay of light and shadow, the warm golden tones against the cool morning airâ€”these are the moments that remind me why I'm drawn to photography as a practice of mindful observation.
