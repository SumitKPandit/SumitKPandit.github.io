# Building Accessible Web Applications

Creating accessible web applications isn't just about complianceâ€”it's about building a more inclusive digital world. When we design with accessibility in mind from the start, we create better experiences for everyone.

## The Foundation: Semantic HTML

The most important accessibility feature of your web application starts with semantic HTML. Every interactive element should be focusable, every form field should have a label, and the document structure should make sense when read by assistive technology.

```html
<!-- Good semantic structure -->
<main>
  <section>
    <h2>User Settings</h2>
    <form>
      <label for="email">Email Address</label>
      <input type="email" id="email" required aria-describedby="email-help">
      <p id="email-help">We'll never share your email address.</p>
    </form>
  </section>
</main>
```

## Beyond Compliance: Universal Design

Accessibility features often benefit all users. Captions help people in noisy environments, keyboard navigation helps power users, and clear visual hierarchy helps everyone understand your content better.

The key is to think of accessibility not as an afterthought, but as a fundamental aspect of good design and development practice.
