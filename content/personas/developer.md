# The Developer

With over a decade of experience in software development, I specialize in creating web applications that prioritize user experience, accessibility, and performance. I work primarily with TypeScript, Vue, and modern web technologies.

My approach to development is informed by my philosophical background—I believe that code should be not just functional, but elegant, maintainable, and ethical in its impact on users and society.

## Technical Expertise

- **Frontend**: Vue.js, React, TypeScript, CSS/SCSS, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub Actions, Vite, Webpack, ESLint, Prettier
- **Architecture**: MVC, Component-based design, RESTful APIs, JAMstack

## Philosophy

I believe in writing code that serves people—code that is accessible, performant, and maintainable. Every technical decision should consider its impact on users, developers, and society as a whole.
