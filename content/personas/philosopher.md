# The Philosopher

As a philosopher, I am deeply interested in questions that bridge the ancient and the contemporary. How do we understand consciousness in an age of artificial intelligence? What does it mean to live meaningfully when technology mediates so much of our experience?

My philosophical work focuses on phenomenology, ethics of technology, and the philosophy of mind. I believe that rigorous thinking about fundamental questions can guide us toward more thoughtful and humane ways of being in the world.
