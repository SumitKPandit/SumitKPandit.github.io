# The Philosopher

I am fascinated by questions at the intersection of technology and human experience. How do the systems we build shape our thinking, our relationships, our possibilities?

My philosophical work draws from phenomenology, pragmatism, and critical theory to examine how digital technologies reshape human experience. I'm particularly interested in questions of agency, attention, and community in digital spaces.

## Research Areas

- **Digital Phenomenology**: How screen-mediated experience shapes consciousness and embodiment
- **Technology Ethics**: Moral dimensions of AI, surveillance, and platform capitalism
- **Critical Theory**: Power structures embedded in technological systems
- **Philosophy of Mind**: Cognitive effects of digital media and human-computer interaction

## Current Projects

I'm currently working on a book examining how digital interfaces shape our understanding of time, space, and social relations. The project draws from Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology and recent work in media archaeology to develop a critical phenomenology of digital experience.

## Academic Background

PhD in Philosophy with focus on Continental Philosophy and Philosophy of Technology. My dissertation examined the phenomenology of digital attention and its implications for democratic discourse.

# The Philosopher

As a philosopher, I am deeply interested in questions that bridge the ancient and the contemporary. How do we understand consciousness in an age of artificial intelligence? What does it mean to live meaningfully when technology mediates so much of our experience?

My philosophical work focuses on phenomenology, ethics of technology, and the philosophy of mind. I believe that rigorous thinking about fundamental questions can guide us toward more thoughtful and humane ways of being in the world.
