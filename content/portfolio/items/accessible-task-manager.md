# Accessible Task Manager

This task management application was built from the ground up with accessibility as a core design principle. Rather than retrofitting accessibility features, I designed the entire interface to work seamlessly with assistive technologies while maintaining an elegant user experience for all users.

## Key Accessibility Features

- **Full keyboard navigation** with logical tab order and visible focus indicators
- **Screen reader optimization** with proper ARIA labels, roles, and live regions
- **High contrast mode** that maintains visual hierarchy and usability
- **Reduced motion support** respecting user preferences for animation
- **Flexible text scaling** supporting up to 200% zoom without layout breaking

## Technical Approach

The application uses Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript for type safety and maintainability. Tailwind CSS provides the styling foundation with custom accessibility utilities I developed for consistent focus management and color contrast.

All interactions are tested with actual screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver) and keyboard-only navigation to ensure real-world usability.
