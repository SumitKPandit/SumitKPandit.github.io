# Software Development Consultant

As an independent consultant, I help organizations build more accessible, performant, and maintainable web applications. My work focuses on bridging the gap between technical implementation and user experience, ensuring that digital products serve all users effectively.

## Consulting Approach

My consulting philosophy emphasizes sustainable solutions over quick fixes. I work closely with client teams to transfer knowledge and establish processes that continue delivering value long after our engagement ends.

## Accessibility Specialization

Having worked with clients ranging from small nonprofits to Fortune 500 companies, I've developed expertise in making accessibility improvements that are both technically sound and financially viable.

## Client Success Stories

Through systematic audits and targeted improvements, I've helped clients not only meet compliance requirements but create genuinely better user experiences that drive business results.
