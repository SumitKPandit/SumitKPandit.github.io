# PhD in Philosophy

My doctoral work explored the phenomenology of digital experience, examining how screen-mediated technologies reshape fundamental aspects of human consciousness and social interaction. This interdisciplinary project drew from Continental philosophy, media studies, and empirical research in human-computer interaction.

## Dissertation Research

"Digital Presence: A Phenomenology of Screen-Mediated Experience" investigated how digital interfaces create new forms of embodied presence and absence. Using phenomenological analysis, I examined how users experience time, space, and intersubjectivity through digital media.

## Teaching Experience

Teaching undergraduate courses gave me valuable experience translating complex philosophical concepts for diverse audiences. I developed innovative pedagogical approaches combining traditional philosophical analysis with contemporary digital media examples.

## Academic Community

Active participation in academic conferences and organizing scholarly events helped me develop strong professional networks and communication skills essential for public-facing intellectual work.
