# Accessibility (A11y)

Accessibility is more than complianceâ€”it's about creating digital experiences that truly work for everyone. My approach combines technical expertise with deep understanding of how people with disabilities interact with technology.

## Core Competencies

- **WCAG Guidelines**: Comprehensive knowledge of WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA requirements and practical implementation
- **Assistive Technology**: Hands-on experience with screen readers, voice recognition software, and keyboard navigation patterns
- **Automated Testing**: Building accessibility testing into CI/CD pipelines using axe-core, WAVE, and custom testing frameworks
- **Manual Testing**: Conducting thorough manual audits and user testing with people who use assistive technologies

## Philosophy

I believe accessibility should be built into the development process from the beginning, not retrofitted later. This approach results in better design, cleaner code, and products that benefit all users, not just those with disabilities.

## Impact

Through my accessibility work, I've helped organizations not only meet legal requirements but discover that accessible design often leads to better overall user experiences and increased customer satisfaction.
