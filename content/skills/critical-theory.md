# Critical Theory

Critical theory provides essential tools for understanding how power operates in contemporary society, particularly through technological systems and cultural formations. My work applies insights from the Frankfurt School to analyze digital capitalism and platform society.

## Theoretical Foundation

- **Frankfurt School Legacy**: Deep engagement with Adorno, Horkheimer, Marcuse, and Benjamin's critique of instrumental reason
- **Contemporary Applications**: Connecting classic critical theory to current issues in digital media, surveillance capitalism, and platform governance
- **Interdisciplinary Approach**: Integrating insights from media studies, political economy, and phenomenology
- **Dialectical Method**: Using negative dialectics to reveal contradictions in technological rationality

## Research Applications

My critical theory work examines how digital technologies reshape social relations, democratic participation, and forms of consciousness. This includes analysis of algorithmic governance, attention economy, and the commodification of social interaction.

## Public Engagement

I believe critical theory should inform public discourse about technology and society. My work aims to make complex theoretical insights accessible for broader conversations about digital rights, platform accountability, and democratic technology governance.
