# TypeScript

TypeScript has become my primary language for both frontend and backend development. Its type system allows me to build more reliable applications while providing excellent developer experience through better tooling and IDE support.

## Key Strengths

- **Advanced Type System**: Deep understanding of generics, conditional types, mapped types, and template literal types
- **Architecture Design**: Structuring large TypeScript applications with proper module organization and dependency management
- **Performance Optimization**: Leveraging TypeScript's compiler options and build tools for optimal bundle sizes
- **Team Integration**: Establishing TypeScript standards and migration strategies for development teams

## Recent Projects

My recent work includes building a comprehensive accessibility testing framework in TypeScript, developing type-safe API clients, and creating developer tools that leverage TypeScript's compiler API for code analysis and transformation.
