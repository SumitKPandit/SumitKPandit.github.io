# Feature Specification: Personal Multi-Persona Website Experience

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-17  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to build my personal website. The website should represent my three personas (philosopher, developer, photographer). To do this, the website must have a resume page where people can find details related to my work as a Senior Software Enginner, a blog where I should be able to write my philosophical insights and a portfolio page where I can showcase my photography in grand and modern way. The website should also have a contact form for user to be able to reach out to me and an about me page where there will be a small introduction of me. Since my philosopher persona is my primary nature, the website should have a calm, soothing, minimal, timeless design. The landing page of the website should be calm, soothing, minimal, timeless yet non-generic and something people should appreciate as unique and beautiful. The website should be easy to maintain and hence all data should come from markdown files and the maintainer of the website should only be required to add/update markdown or media (text/image/audio/video) file to update/add content. The website should be highly search engine optimized on all pages. Go and specify everything required for creating this masterpiece."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a visitor, I want to understand the individual quickly—across philosophical thinking, software engineering expertise, and photographic artistry—through a cohesive, calm, minimal, and timeless presentation so that I can evaluate credibility, explore content of interest, and optionally initiate contact.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a first‑time visitor on the landing page, **When** they scroll or lightly explore primary sections, **Then** they can identify the three personas and reach any persona-specific area (resume, blog, photography portfolio) within two intuitive clicks or taps.
2. **Given** a user on the resume page, **When** they review professional history, skills, and achievements, **Then** they can understand senior engineering credibility and locate a call-to-contact action without distraction.
3. **Given** a user on the blog index, **When** they scan entries, **Then** they can discern philosophical topics via clear titles, dates, short synopsis, and navigate to a full article.
4. **Given** a user on a photography portfolio page, **When** they browse featured works, **Then** imagery is presented in a visually compelling gallery that emphasizes quality without performance delays or intrusive UI.
5. **Given** a visitor wishes to reach out, **When** they open the contact form, **Then** they can submit a concise message with essential details and receive an immediate confirmation state.
6. **Given** a search engine crawler, **When** it indexes any page, **Then** structured metadata (titles, descriptions, canonical identity, persona context) is present so the intent of each page is unambiguous.
7. **Given** new content is added via a single new Markdown file, **When** the site is rebuilt, **Then** the new content appears in the correct section automatically with no further manual wiring.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a visitor navigates to a removed or mistyped URL? → Should reach a graceful not‑found page reinforcing brand aesthetic and offering clear return paths.
- How does system handle extremely large image sets in photography section? → Portfolio listing paginated (12 items per page default; user can navigate to subsequent pages) to preserve load performance and cognitive focus.
- What if contact form submission lacks required fields? → Inline, accessible field-level and summary validation for required: name, email, message; optional: subject. Submit disabled until required are valid.
- What if there is no current blog content? → Provide placeholder messaging emphasizing forthcoming philosophical essays, while preserving minimal aesthetic.
- How should draft or unpublished content behave? → Any Markdown with `draft: true` front‑matter is excluded from indices, feeds, navigation, and sitemap; direct access returns not‑found.
- How to handle media that fails to load (e.g., missing image)? → Fallback alt text / neutral placeholder maintaining layout integrity.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST present a landing page clearly reflecting three distinct personas (philosopher, developer, photographer) in a unified, minimal narrative.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST provide a resume page conveying professional summary, experience timeline, key skills, recognitions/achievements, and an action to initiate contact.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST allow author to publish long-form philosophical articles as Markdown files that automatically appear in a blog index ordered by publish date (newest first).
- **FR-004**: The system MUST allow photography works to be curated into a portfolio experience emphasizing visual impact and categorization or grouping (e.g., series/themes) for discoverability.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST provide an about page summarizing personal narrative, overarching philosophy, and context unifying personas.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST provide a contact form enabling visitors to submit a message with necessary sender identification and purpose.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST allow adding or updating public content solely by adding/editing Markdown (and associated media) without altering application logic.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST automatically generate navigation and internal linking from content structure (no hard-coded menu duplication across files).
- **FR-009**: The system MUST expose page-level metadata (title, description, canonical slug, publish/modified date where applicable) suitable for search engine indexing.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST support a timeless, calm visual style (minimal color palette, low visual noise, balanced whitespace) consistently across all pages.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST provide a not‑found experience guiding users back to core areas (home, blog, portfolio, resume, contact).
- **FR-012**: The system MUST distinguish persona context so that users entering via deep links can still discover the other personas.
- **FR-013**: The system MUST allow marking content as draft so it is excluded from public listings using a boolean front‑matter field `draft: true` (default absence/false = publishable).
- **FR-014**: The system MUST ensure each blog article includes title, excerpt/summary, publish date, and optional hero media reference.
- **FR-015**: The system MUST ensure each portfolio entry includes title, image(s) reference, optional description/context, and display order.
- **FR-016**: The system MUST allow grouping portfolio entries by thematic "collection" (single collection required; optional secondary collection tags not allowed to reduce complexity in initial release).
- **FR-017**: The system MUST present consistent internal navigation accessible within two interactions from any page to reach any persona root.
- **FR-018**: The system MUST provide accessible text alternatives for all meaningful imagery.
- **FR-019**: The system MUST display human-friendly error feedback for invalid contact form submissions.
- **FR-020**: The system MUST record essential submission data (name, email, message, timestamp) in a private submissions log and trigger an owner notification (e.g., email or inbox) within minutes of submission.
- **FR-021**: The system MUST prevent duplicate portfolio items by enforcing globally unique slugs; collision fails build/release approval.
- **FR-022**: The system MUST allow chronological and thematic exploration of writings via one required primary category (e.g., Philosophy, Software, Photography, Intersections) plus up to six optional tags for finer facets.
- **FR-023**: The system MUST ensure newly added Markdown appears in navigation or indices without manual registration.
- **FR-024**: The system MUST provide a consistent reading layout optimizing line length for readability.
- **FR-025**: The system MUST differentiate primary persona (philosopher) emphasis on landing page while still surfacing developer and photographer aspects.
- **FR-026**: The system MUST ensure search engines can parse structured data covering: Person (author), WebSite identity, BreadcrumbList (navigation hierarchy), Article (for blog posts), and CreativeWork/ImageObject (for portfolio items) to enhance rich result eligibility.

- **FR-029**: The system MUST paginate portfolio listings at 12 items per page (default) with clear navigation to additional pages/collections.
- **FR-030**: The system MUST implement anti-spam measures (hidden honeypot field + basic submission frequency limit of 3 successful submissions per originating source per hour) while keeping the form frictionless for legitimate users.
- **FR-031**: The system MUST define and apply a three-tier skill proficiency scale: Expert (deep authority), Proficient (reliably effective), Foundational (working knowledge) across resume skill presentations.
- **FR-032**: The system MUST enforce a maximum of six tags per blog article to preserve taxonomy clarity.
- **FR-033**: The system MUST retain contact submissions for 12 months then purge or archive to protect privacy and reduce data accumulation.
- **FR-027**: The system MUST ensure canonical URLs to avoid duplicate indexing.
